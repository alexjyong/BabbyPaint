BabbyPaint is designed to be as simple as possible, perfect for little hands to start drawing without getting overwhelmed by options. It has a minimal interface with just the essentials: drawing, erasing, and a palette of fun colors.

It even includes a handy "lock" button, preventing any accidental taps or swipes from leaving the app during creative time.

No ads to distract your child, no in-app purchases, app doesn't steal your data, and is completely open-source and free!

Currently works best in portrait mode on your phone.
