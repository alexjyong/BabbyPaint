# BabbyPaint
Simple little paint application for kids.

First things first, credit to [Lachlan Dawson](https://codepen.io/Lachlandawson) for the base code in this project from [here](https://codepen.io/Lachlandawson/pen/abmdyV). 

I got the idea to do this when I was trying to find a simple paint applcation for my young daughter's tablet and couldn't find an app that did exactly what I wanted. So I figured I could make my own!
